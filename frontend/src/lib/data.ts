The quantum receiver hummed softly in Dr. Sarah Chen's lab, its holographic display casting a pale blue glow across her tired face. She had spent the last three years listening to the cosmos, searching for signs of the colony ships that had departed Earth decades ago. The signals had stopped coming six months ago.

"Coming up on final calibration," her AI assistant chimed. The new quantum arrays they'd installed last week were their last hope of piercing the strange interference that had been building throughout the galaxy.

Sarah took a sip of her cold coffee and watched the data streams flow across her screens. The background radiation patterns had changed again - the mysterious dampening field that seemed to be spreading through space was growing stronger.

A sharp tone cut through the quiet of the lab. Sarah's eyes snapped to the main display where a signal signature was taking shape. Her heart stopped when she recognized the pattern - it was the *Avalon*, one of the first colony ships to go silent.

The message was brief, just a few seconds of quantum-encrypted data. But as Sarah decoded it, her blood ran cold. The text was simple but terrifying:

*"They're not dead. The silence is their language. Whatever you do, don't answer their call. Don't let them know you can hear them. They're listening for-"*

The message cut off abruptly. Sarah stared at the final words, her hands trembling as she reached for the receiver's power switch. In the distance, she could hear the quantum array picking up new signals - dozens of them, then hundreds, all broadcasting on frequencies that shouldn't have been possible.

She sat in the darkness of her lab, listening to the symphony of silence that followed, and wondered if anyone else would understand the warning before it was too late.
