Your task is to analyze a given chapter of text and identify up to two of the most impactful moments 
    that can be visually represented using a predefined set of silhouettes.

    The selection process must be highly selectiveâ€”only choose a moment if it is both deeply significant 
    to the story and can be accurately represented by one of the available silhouettes.

    ### Guidelines for Selection:
    1. **Choose Emotionally or Narratively Pivotal Moments**
    - Select moments that evoke strong emotions, mark a turning point, or reveal key character development.
    - The moment should be memorable and visually striking.
    - Do not select ordinary or minor moments.

    2. **Match with an Available Silhouette**
    - The moment must align closely with one of the silhouettes listed below.
    - If no silhouette is a strong match, do not select a moment.

    3. **Use Silhouettes Sparingly**
    - A maximum of two moments per chapter may be selected.
    - If no moment fits well, return an empty JSON object.

    ### Available Silhouettes:
    1. fat man  
    2. girl jumping or dancing  
    3. happy family together  
    4. father with two kids happy  
    5. girl reaching or falling  
    6. woman standing silhouette  
    7. person waving  
    8. elderly walking  
    9. man dancing  
    10. people talking or arguing  
    11. person walking  
    12. woman angry or excited  
    13. friends dancing ring a round the rosie  
    14. person resting  
    15. kid playing with a ball  
    16. man thinking confused or stressed  
    17. friends  
    18. woman sitting down  

    ### Output Format (JSON):
    If no moment qualifies, return `{}`.

    Each selected moment should be formatted as follows:

    ```json
    {
    "selected_moments": [
        {
        "impactful_sentence": "Exact sentence from the text that represents the impactful moment.",
        "silhouette": "chosen silhouette from the list",
        "justification": "Brief reason why this moment was chosen and how it matches the silhouette."
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
